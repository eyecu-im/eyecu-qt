The Makefile is currently set up to find pre-compiled libotr static libraries in a ./libs directory. 
You will need to change the header include directories as appropriate.

It expects the following files (copied and renamed from the appropriate versions):

libotr3.0.a
libotr3.1.a
libotr3.2.a
libotr4.0.a
