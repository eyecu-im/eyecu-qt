corresponding to one account establishing OTR sessions with another account with multiple 4.0 clients.

multiple 4.0 clients.  This test also includes another 3.X with one of these accounts.  All 3.X versions are tested.

Executing one of the above files directly will execute the corresponding test. The underlying instant messaging server
